# IO.Swagger - the C# library for the Screenshot Capture API

Webseite-Herunterladen.de Screenshot Capture is a very simple but powerful screenshot API that anyone can easily use to create pixel-perfect website screenshots. It always uses a recent version of Chrome to ensure that all modern web features are fully supported and rendering is exactly as your customers would expect.

This C# SDK is automatically generated by the [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project:

- API version: 1.0.0
- SDK version: 1.0.0
- Build package: io.swagger.codegen.v3.generators.dotnet.CSharpClientCodegen

<a name="frameworks-supported"></a>
## Frameworks supported
- .NET 4.0 or later
- Windows Phone 7.1 (Mango)

<a name="dependencies"></a>
## Dependencies
- [RestSharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RestSharp) - 105.1.0 or later
- [Json.NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/) - 7.0.0 or later
- [JsonSubTypes](https://www.nuget.org/packages/JsonSubTypes/) - 1.2.0 or later

The DLLs included in the package may not be the latest version. We recommend using [NuGet](https://docs.nuget.org/consume/installing-nuget) to obtain the latest version of the packages:
```
Install-Package RestSharp
Install-Package Newtonsoft.Json
Install-Package JsonSubTypes
```

NOTE: RestSharp versions greater than 105.1.0 have a bug which causes file uploads to fail. See [RestSharp#742](https://github.com/restsharp/RestSharp/issues/742)

<a name="installation"></a>
## Installation
Run the following command to generate the DLL
- [Mac/Linux] `/bin/sh build.sh`
- [Windows] `build.bat`

Then include the DLL (under the `bin` folder) in the C# project, and use the namespaces:
```csharp
using IO.Swagger.Api;
using IO.Swagger.Client;
using IO.Swagger.Model;
```
<a name="packaging"></a>
## Packaging

A `.nuspec` is included with the project. You can follow the Nuget quickstart to [create](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/quickstart/create-and-publish-a-package#create-the-package) and [publish](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/quickstart/create-and-publish-a-package#publish-the-package) packages.

This `.nuspec` uses placeholders from the `.csproj`, so build the `.csproj` directly:

```
nuget pack -Build -OutputDirectory out IO.Swagger.csproj
```

Then, publish to a [local feed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/hosting-packages/local-feeds) or [other host](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/hosting-packages/overview) and consume the new package via Nuget as usual.

{
    public class Example
    {
        public void main()
        {
            var apiInstance = new ScreenshotApi();
            var token = token_example;  // string | A valid token is needed to make paid API calls. Tokens can be managed from your account.
            var hash = hash_example;  // string | The hash value is for authenticated requests. If you want to publish this URL, you should use the authenticated requests.
            var url = url_example;  // string | The URL of the website you want to capture. Please include the protocol (http:// or https://).
            var fileType = fileType_example;  // string | The image file format of the captured screenshot. Either png, jpeg, webp or PDF with 72 dpi. (optional)  (default to png)
            var ttl = 789;  // long? | Number of seconds the capture file is cached by our CDN. An API request that is loaded through the cache does not count as a paid request. You can set a number of seconds from 0 seconds up to 2592000 seconds. This is a maximum of 30 days. (optional) 
            var invalidate = true;  // bool? | Force the API to invalidate the cache and capture a new screenshot. This call costs you additional money, because a call of a cache hit is not charged. (optional) 
            var full = true;  // bool? | Set this parameter to true if you want to screenshot the whole web page in full size. (optional) 
            var lazyloadScroll = true;  // bool? | Set this parameter to true to scroll down through the entire page before taking a screenshot. This is useful for triggering animations or lazy load elements in full screen. (optional)  (default to false)
            var delay = 789;  // long? | The delay in milliseconds to wait after the page loads before taking the screenshot. This is in milliseconds. One second is 1000 milliseconds. From 0 milliseconds to a maximum of 10,000 milliseconds. (optional) 
            var width = 789;  // long? | The width, in pixels, of the browser viewport to use. (optional)  (default to 1920)
            var height = 789;  // long? | The height, in pixels, of the browser viewport to use. Ignored if you set full to true. (optional)  (default to 1080)
            var quality = 789;  // long? | The quality of the image between 0 and 100. This works only for the jpeg format, for PNG images the parameter is applied only during compression. (optional)  (default to 90)
            var scale = 1.2;  // decimal? | The scale factor of the device to use when taking the screenshot. For example, a scale factor of 2 produces a high-resolution screenshot suitable for viewing on Retina devices. The larger the scale factor, the larger the screenshot produced. (optional)  (default to 1.0)
            var x = 789;  // long? | The starting point of a section screenshot on the X axis. (optional)  (default to 0)

            var cookies = cookies_example;  // string | A semicolon-separated list of cookies to be used when capturing the screenshot. Each cookies should be passed as a key-value pair and multiple pairs should be separated by a semicolon. (optional) 
            var css = css_example;  // string | Inject your custom CSS. (optional)

            var wait = wait_example;  // string | Wait until the specified CSS selector matches an element present in the page before taking a screenshot. The process is canceled after 60 seconds. (optional) 
            var element = element_example;  // string | Takes a screenshot of the first element matched by the specified CSS selector. This is ignored if full is true. (This option cannot be used with the PDF export format.) (optional)
